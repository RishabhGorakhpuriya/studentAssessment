## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (locally or a cloud instance)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the necessary environment variables. Example:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
    PORT=5000
    ```

5. **Start the backend server:**

    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```

    npm start
    ```

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - Contains the ReactJS application.
  - `src/` - Source files for React components and other frontend logic.
- `backend/` - Contains the Node.js and Express.js server.
  - `routes/` - API routes.
  - `models/` - Mongoose models for MongoDB.
  - `controllers/` - Business logic for handling requests.
  - `index.js` - Entry point for the backend server.

## Usage

1. **Frontend**: The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. It interacts with the backend to provide the user interface and experience.

2. **Backend**: The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or any other port specified in your `.env` file). It handles API requests and interacts with the MongoDB database.
